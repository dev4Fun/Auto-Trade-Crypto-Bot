## Getting started

1. Create a bot by starting a chat with **BotFather** and record your Telegram token
2. Get API keys (api key and secret) for your exchange
3. Install dependencies: `pip install python-telegram-bot ccxt`
4. Create secrets.txt in config folder with following content:
 ```
# YOUR_API_KEY
# YOUR_SECRET
# YOUR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN
# YOUR_TELEGRAM_USER_ID
```

5. Run main.py

I only change readme file
